* Hard Redirect

A simple browser extension to redirect urls defined by *you* in the source code.

** Features
- Regex defined url matching.
- Enable/Disable redirects in popup menu.

** How to add redirects

Redirects are defined at the top of background.js.

#+begin_src javascript
   let redirectList = [
    { id: 1, label: "google  -> startpage", from: "https://www.google.com/(.*)", to: "https://www.startpage.com/\\1", enabled: false },
    { id: 2, label: "youtube -> piped", from: "(.*)youtube.com/(.*)", to: "https://piped.kavin.rocks/\\2", enabled: true },
    { id: 3, label: "reddit  -> libreddit", from: "(.*)reddit.com(.*)", to: "https://libredd.it/\\2", enabled: true },
]
#+end_src

Redirects are comprised of:

*id:* sequential number to identify individual redirects.

*label:* how the redirect is shown in the popup menu for enabling/disabling redirects.

*from:* pattern to redirect.

*to:* result of redirection.

*enabled:* the default state of the redirect.

** Regex matching

This random google support answer describes the syntax quite well. \\

** Install
 1. Navigate to: chrome://extensions/
 2. Toggle "Developer mode" in the top right.
 3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the hard-redirect directory

** Firefox
Firefox(nightly.101.0a1) does not implement Manifest v3.

Hard Redirect uses *Declarative Net Request (DNR)* which is very different from
the manifest v2 *chrome.webRequest*.

** Twitter...
Twitter uses service workers which do not play nicely with DNR.

Workarounds:
1. Directly changing the url with a content script when on twitter.com. Better
   described in this [[https://superuser.com/questions/1630145/redirect-twitter-home-to-twitter-notifications-using-chrome-extension/16302][superuser question]].
2. Disable all javascript for twitter. No javascript = no service workers = no
   problems. Just remember to delete the existing service worker if there is one.
